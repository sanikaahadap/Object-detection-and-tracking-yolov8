# Object Detection and Tracking Using YOLOv8
This project implements a robust object detection and tracking system using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8). YOLOv8 is the latest version in the YOLO series, known for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection tasks.

The project includes:
Object Detection: Identifying and labeling objects within images and videos, providing bounding boxes for each detected object.
Object Tracking: Continuously tracking the detected objects across video frames, ensuring accurate and persistent identification even with motion.
